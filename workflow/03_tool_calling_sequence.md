# Workflow 3: Gemini Tool-Calling Sequence

> **Chapter 9.2** — Integrating specialist tools: how Gemini autonomously orchestrates multi-tool calls

This sequence diagram traces the exact message flow between the Streamlit UI, the Gemini agent, and each external tool during a treatment recommendation generation.

    User->>UI: Enter ZIP code + infestation level

    Note over Agent: Session initialized with<br/>tools: [get_weather, get_soil_type,<br/>search_amazon_products]

    UI->>Agent: generate_treatment_recommendations(context)
    Note over Agent: STEP 1: Treatment text (no products)

    Agent->>Weather: get_weather(zipcode)
    Weather-->>Agent: {temperature, forecast_3day, wind}

    Agent->>Soil: get_soil_type(zipcode)
    Soil-->>Agent: {soil_name, texture, pH, drainage}

    Note over Agent: Gemini synthesizes weather + soil<br/>→ writes treatment paragraphs
    Agent-->>UI: treatment_text

    Note over Agent: STEP 2: Product search
    Agent->>Search: search_amazon_products("organic neem oil")
    Search-->>Agent: [{name, url}, ...]

    Agent->>Search: search_amazon_products("Bt spray caterpillars")
    Search-->>Agent: [{name, url}, ...]

    Agent-->>UI: products_text

    UI-->>User: Treatment Plan + Product Links

    User->>UI: Click "Soil Impact" tab
    UI->>Agent: answer_menu_option(context, option=2)
    Note over Agent: Re-uses existing chat session<br/>(conversation history preserved)
    Agent-->>UI: Soil analysis paragraph
    UI-->>User: Soil impact analysis
```

## Agentic Autonomy

The agent decides **which tools to call and in what order** based solely on the prompt. There is no hard-coded orchestration — Gemini reads the context and determines:
1. Weather data is needed → calls `get_weather()`
2. Soil data is needed → calls `get_soil_type()`
3. Products are requested → calls `search_amazon_products()` 2–3 times with specific queries

This is the core demonstration of **Section 9.2**: the LLM acts as the orchestrator, not as a simple function router.
